# eggnog-dominance

<ins>please understand me using your sharp mind chilly.</ins>  

i do not hold a position AGAINST Google.  
- i am not against:
  - globalism
  - anti-competitive conduct [monopoly]
  - copyright issues [with Google Print, Books, and Library]
  - tax avoidance
  - tracking
  - advertisement [even without revenue-share]
  - ranking manipulation by sites' owners
  - Google Shopping rankings
  - bogus "reality interface" [that is a fault of "broken" users, not search engine's]
  - filter bubble [ideological frame]
  - censorship of searches for "gorilla," "chimp," "chimpanzee," and "monkey." no, really, i do not mind

i am FOR Google. i want it to become better
- all aforementioned points could be called critical issues, but i am against other things:
  - imbecilty of outsiders pretending to be a programmer after completing university education
  - politics
  - socialism
  - money
  - promotion of predatory values

in russian 'eggnog' sounds like 'gogol-mogol'. why do you think that mathematician had chosen this word?  
not because of a love to chickens, as you can guess.
## don't play tricks you're making your love into a steak
no, i do not blame Google for [removing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google#Russia) "Smart Navalniy" from Play Store.  
you see, while computational power of machines becomes greater and greater with each year, more and more imbeciles decide to study a programming and so software gets increasingly more imbecilically written.  
i am against politics. i am against politicians and their hypocritical ill reasoning.  
i am not a friend to Gandi. i am not a friend to Mandela.  
if i could hate anyone [i cannot by my nature] i would hate Navalniy and indeed some of my friends do hate him.  
when i recollect that Zelenskiy does support so-called "abortion rights" and "legalisation of sex work" i want to kill him [nevertheless i do not think that Putin has strong anti-abortion position].  

no. Google and western-world socialism [so-called "democracy"] support my enemies like Russia not by removing entitling software items from their Play Stores.  
they phase out me.  
they stand for abortion rights and sex work, if you want.  
because if you want them to, they cancel me and torture me, while declaring false freedoms and morally re-assuring sentiments of cultural isolation.  
my tablet runs android OS from 2011 [in 2023]. my smartphone runs android OS from 2014 [at best].  
is this any wrong on Earth to have an operating system is twelve years old?  
i would not be able to explain it to my children after all those thousands of years would pass and i would give birth, thanks to God.  
i cannot justify technology restriction while seeing futher in year two-thousands-to-come.  
all those sufferings of innocent men supposedly coming from russian government having their latest lavish model iPhones updated and running are just a hypocritical stance of other gedonist governments and layman socialists.  
i cannot imagine myself being killed or tortured by a compiler [sic].  
yes, i agree, kernel devs are true refusing to russian CPU manufacturer of a push request. those folks run missiles and ubutank OS on their CPUs. russian bankers have their emergency smartphones made by those factories.  
but after Google has sanctioned Russia [and Russia sanctioned it back] nothing really changed for good at Kremlin: shithead have their latest lavish model android phones updated and running, their tech staff access [Google devs' sites](https://developer.android.com/ndk/) from under [The Great Boxer Briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_briefs) while making DNS-poisons and promiscuous denials [to newest tunneling technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WireGuard).

i mean it is DEAD.  
Great Snake has died last month.

so you may stop waiting mobile version of karhidish clock and calligraphy apps from me.  
firstly Google and other western socialists restrict access to victims of russian invasion then russian military themself block tech companies.  
and they all DO win, you see. they all get what they want --russians get their gory laws appraised and get mustachy looking supersonics while more refined socialists [so-called "democrats"] get their compassion grades and a sense of superiority over rubble post-ukrainian digital natives.  
being restricted from my native activity of a hacker i am feeling great pain.  
they say endure your emotional pain for the sake of raped and dying children. pain destroys brain. 
we remember Bucha!!![^1]
