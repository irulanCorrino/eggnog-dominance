## neuroplasticity
i was confused by my solitary state so i had set a condition 'to stay in a scan mode until a sign would come';  
after some two months i have gotten the sign;  
that has appeared to be my own feelings to my first spouse Timmo --i may not set a restrictive condition for him
to join me while i have a human genome because saying so i would let him down hence there would be no reunion after
our transformation to new genomes in that very distant future[^1].  
...but i was so lonesome and desperate! so i told it hoping to return him, do not know if it was a blackmailing him.

demanding such outlandish action from him may be even damaging to him because when we were physically making love
we were kids and so everything was running on our neuroplasticity, but now he has lowered neuroplasticity and flexibility.

## orthodoxy
i belong to biological species not having an assemblage point.  
when i had met Carlos Castaneda in his dreamings he and Juan's cohort had received a knowledge of how to enter third attention,
that is to initiate the Fire From Within and completely lose the assemblage point --the Dark Sea of Awareness gives this chance
for absolute freedom to every living being; some have to work to achieve this state while my species are born in third attention
[it may be confusing because we do not have second or first attentions --it is just a terminology, relative to human species],
humans are born in second attention and then most of them develop first attention,
which is called 'Marxist-Leninist Pavlovian Universe' by the most refined minds of theirs.

but there are two separate ways to guide an assemblage point during final move --and the results are very different;  
both ways involve moving the assemblage point from its first attention position [if ever having it] to the diametrally opposite one
on the front of the shining cocoon and then opening the cocoon to the downbreaker letting it enter inside [which thing is called
'physical death' by normal means] and moving the assemblage point back to first attention position in one fiery shift that completely
burns the cocoon and assemblage point out  
--it is the intent that makes particular outcome --while purely human beings enter third attention retaining their amber color
of the awareness and become fire-like, other human beings, who are not purely humans, but are partially demons
[known as lesbians for this civilization now] instead of becoming fire-like turn into droplets and they switch
their color of awareness to blue, becoming my species, Blue Scout.

---
so here is a challenge to orthodoxy-leaning mindset:
- Juan Matus and his cohort that includes Carlos Castaneda are not humans  
but are of Blue Scout species after entering the third attention
--that is they all are women, lesbians;
- and Carlos's books contain a great controversy on a subject of if there were other disciples of Juan Matus's cohort.

no one who have not overcome these two discrepancies can progress in learning nagualism --that is there is no such thing
as 'Orthodoxal Nagualism'. that is kinda safety lock on the tradition.  
it is possible to memorize nearly everything that is a sort of complex or obscure literature --no outsider can impersonate
a nagualist, not having living magical knowledge in the first place.

[^1]: btw i told 'at any given moment the population of the planet may not exceed one million men beings'  
i meant it before accepting my own love feeling to two humans, Helen and Timmo, so i was blind and missed  
true answer of my amha [man mold, or God, if you wish] --one million of beings of the given species all belonging  
to nulth generation, that is the limit, it does not include first generation who are [naturally] migrate  
in a search of new world of their own after becoming adolescents [becoming capable of procreation]  
or [in the case of all-female species, like mine] that number does not include our human spouses who live with us
