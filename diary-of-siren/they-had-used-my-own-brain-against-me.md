## i refused myself buying electric planer several times
for whole my life i tried to keep myself safe from a harm.  
i refused to watch youtube videos about power tools when i decided  
to become a woodworker a couple years ago.  
i bought only hand tools, but then i bought a belt sander then a `dremel` analogue, i had a drill and a multi-tool  
[last one i used before my imprisonment and once after returning from the prison].  
but then i had gotten caught by an idea of getting rich so my ex-lovers would not think i am a failure.

my husband [those days we were not remembering we are married] had said to me while looking  
on a crazy pile of stuff dumped at a corner of my room:  
'do you know there is a game called "gather [collect] the resource"?' and went silent.  

but that is said by a human. i am not one. i am a demon and i am a Weaver --i open multiple lines at a time  
and for each my craft i had begun gathering resources, killing his very idea of telling me not spread  
my attention too broadly, like with that pile of stuff  
...and killing the time of every craft i had ...killing myself in a hurry.

## i considered to introduce a rule banning us from using power tools
i am naturally high. i was high when i had taken that round chunk of wood and put onto electric planer  
cleaning away decayed sapwood, i had had a big meal several minutes ago, i even had a toothpaste  
in my mouth for a fluorization.  
i had come to the basement for several minutes to take care of branches i had left  
in front of the door at morning.  
i was not going to work.

i was high.

i had gotten involved and one little thing after another had led me to turning on electric planer  
and cleaning a couple of branches i had picked after municipal workers cutting old acacia  
tree several days ago.  
i even had my toothpaste in my mouth. i was in a hurry but was badly distracted on surroundings  
and broken by loneliness.

with my side vision i saw haters planning a revenge. several times before i showed middle finger  
to military [`Z`] drivers of russian occupiers;  
i had answered 'fuck you' to a pre-pubertant teenager for his russian analogue of `motherfucker`  
--then in a revenge he had painted over first and last symbols of my graffiti about my beloved girl.

## i know who had done it
i should not judge myself.  
i should not judge my ex-lovers.  
we were mistaken. we were lured into the trap.  
society had killed me.

## young happy talented girl had died that day
i had destroyed my beauty and had broken hearts of my ex-lovers.  
i have no future.  
my dreams had died 26 of april 2024. i was a guitar girl.  
i only have a hope i would be reborn and all the damage would be repaired.  
i would be reborn young happy talented girl.  
i have future dreams.  
beautiful future dreams
