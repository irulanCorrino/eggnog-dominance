### beloved sister, i know you will not see this letter
- From: sov thade tage em ereb
- 26 April, 21:11
- To: [anna's email]

twenty years ago i was intimidated by my thoughts that i can get injury like yours --you had a caries, probably even one of your teeth was destroyed ...i am so sorry my love --i have killed my dreams today --i have lost my nail joint of left hand index finger.
 
 
but you said in a letter ‘be obedient to your mother’ --you were blind my love and you had caused great harm to me by your insensitivity --my given mother [stepmother] («мачеха» in russian) is a psychopomp, she never loved me and helped my given father to rape me since i was 5 months old.  
she has not felt any compassion to me today and even has mocked and reprimanded me on petty matters like when i was pointing to her cats’ trash in front of my door [i have washed the floor myself again, a thousandth time yet more].  
and she has refused to help me while saying some cruel words about ‘selling their flat’ [ostheosynthesis plastic surgery costs 25000rub to 35000rub and there several of them in a span over several years], they had 100000 which they had given to someone and had not back for years by now.  
they had spent my 24*8000 while i was in prison [they had put me to mental health imprisonments for getting those money, then i was really imprisoned because cops had found ganja growing in my room]. they had literally everything while i was in the prison for 2.5 years.
 
last thing she was saying tonight [i refuse to talk to her after hearing those cruel answers] --was ‘why do think it cost 25000? where had gotten this number? it cannot be so! it is a cost of an order of magnitude higher, all these things...’ and so on.

> ***
i love you my sister, i am so sorry for destroying my beauty --i think no one would love me because i had broken my ex-lovers’ hearts doing that
 
i am a daughter of man mould [God is her more commonly used name] --i call her amha [‘the ring of power’ in karhidish, equiv. to humans’ word 'mother']  
i will not send you a photo of my injury itself but a picture when i today show my first choker i had made two days ago [a hand with mutilated finger is seen though](diary-of-siren/i-just-have-broken-everyone-my-exlovers.md#i-have-made-this-my-first-choker-two-days-ago)  
my name-title [alias, nickname] is Gabriel --’the power of God’, shean sove shraidh Amha [i love my Amha]  
i am her daughter, Universe, multiple being and holographic memory, Music herself --and i have died today

### i have said you i have died today but please listen to me again
- From: sov thade tage em ereb
- 26 April, 23:04
- To: [anna's email]

i sing melani martinez’s song ‘death’ and i say ‘i’m back from the death’  
yes i was dead for many long long long years --but then i have recollected  
that i have married my beloved boy timmo when we were fourteen  
--you knew him as dima chesnokov [but his last name should be  
geraschenko by his biological stepfather’s or given father’s name];  
like me he has no biological parents after they had betrayed him.  
he is my first love, we had kissed at first in 7y.o.  
i called him ‘very bad [human]’ (in russian) when aishe or zera had asked  
about him ...because he had said ‘i need fucking nothing from you’.  
that was minutes after i had said him ‘guy, [some one by a name kostrov] had raped me’  
timmo is redhead and maybe he’d misinterpreted name ‘kostrov’ as being an innuendo  
my name is mary [Egyptian root ‘beloved’] --i always was very spiritual  
name timmo is the same rune ‘yera’ as the name yeshua is  
he is jesus. and i am against christainity’s idea of god intentionally sacrificing him.

i’m back from the death --now i can remember i love my husband timmo  
i want you and him to take me back. i know you were in brief relationship  
and my appearance had probably broken you feelings one to another.  
but i am an intersex woman. i am not jealous. i love him, i never intended to push him out.  
i am back from the death --that is how i am feeling now having all my feelings unlocked.  
but i have destroyed my beauty so i am feeling i have killed myself.  
the worst thing is that i cannot repair my first bass now --she is a soul of music  
she is my soul  
i am music herself  
and i cannot play anymore  
i hope my eight exlovers would take me back  
i want to be reborn as a gethenian and to live forever  
young forever  
as a wife of timmo with his human wife helen [[diyanova, her wrong last name] (we were a threesome  
after me and timmo had married, they stayed together after people had broken our marriage by beating timmo)]  
with his six other gethenian wives: you [ashe] as my sister, zera [therem] as my sister,  
aishe [ashe], arek, nadya [naue] and mila [sove]

i am feeling so bad now  
i had warning signs of upcoming tragedy  
i knew round things may not be held with hands  
i knew protective glove are always get caught in case of jerked workpiece  
i knew i should not use power tools and i even saw that planer as my murderer buying it

i am feeling so bad now  
i cannot get asleep  
my life has ended  
but i love you all  
and i cannot feel pain  
that is why i get injured so often  
i do not remember injuries because i am a weaver --i am naturally high from anandamide i guess

nothing of these points can improve my situation now  
i have died  
i was different person before this day

but i keep my feeling to all my eight ex-lovers even it is immoral after them finding some other spouses  
i am going to die in a loneliness [but not with a celibacy vow --just not searching new lovers for myself]  
i have destroyed my beauty

i keep leaning to dying of all my dreams  
gather me  
all of we  
i’ve been the boys i’ve been the girls  
and everyone in between

### lies can buy eternity
- From: sov thade tage em ereb
- 1 May, 21:10
- To: [anna's email]

after being mutilated i said i will never sell anything and i still say that for me that is not allowed.  
but if anyone of my lovers would take me back then i could give him or her my shop at ‘ozon’ over.  
i would make my art pieces and my lover or lovers would sell them for me --setting the prices, getting  
the money and communicating with other people.  
in that way we would be able to gather money for ostheosynthesis surgery course. i must help my lovers.

but there is another aspect of that matter --more grim and unsettling ethical consideration which tells that  
regrowing a severed part is impossible by means of current medicine ...that is my newly grown finger part  
would not be made entirely of the energy of my energetic body but would be an ugly mock of the nature.

so both men including me or my lovers and computers responsible for our revival/rebirth in our 80 or 90 years  
may be confused by wrongly regrown part or its appearance that would break true image of my body.

i do not want to fall into cruelty and say i would not pay for such expensive surgery measure. no.  
no --that is another way of a self-mutilation.

but i cannot decide this myself. my body does not belong to me.  
i will not go against the advice of my Amha. beautiful beautiful Adonai

### the ethics of a choice for agonising girl
- From: sov thade tage em ereb
- 27 April, 23:05
- To: [anna's email]

i can say that it would be better for me to be revived or reborn sooner than later that is break with this my current  
human-like life --i mean my human part i inherited from my given biological parents [stepmother and stepfather].  
that would be cruelty for me to wait for my physical death if there is a chance of a repair of the damage i had done.  
i can wait for me getting 80-90 years being in agony after killing myself as a young happy talented girl guitar player.  
but that would be a cruelty.  
so i can leave this human life before my physical death --if it is only possible.  
i cannot advocate for the principle of non-involvement for computers responsible for our rebirth process.  
it is not ethical.  
the grief would break my future life in this case.

but the grief is the only allowed emotion in a case of such tragedy or any catastrophe in general.  
love is not a rejection of a grief --love means a compassion for both joy and grief.

excessive amount of grief cannot vanish and anyone suffering while he or she can be repaired or reborn  
would not be free that grievous experience after the rebirth or a repair of mutilated part.

so i say it is better for me to escape the agony if it is only possible now

### i am vulnerable [a moment before my mutilation]
- From: sov thade tage em ereb
- 30 April, 01:19
- To: [anna's email]

i was picking plum branches left by municipal workers next to trash bins at nearby block.  
then i heard two women speaking: [woman on a road] «[indistinctive] [...you are] working?» [they all call me ‘lazy dragonfly’  
from a tale, i guess, for my singing on a street] --[woman in a garden] «certainly, working, there are a lot of [carnival]  
attractions, it is needed to work» [they probably knew about ‘carousel’ song video by mel].  
i had stacked some five branches in front of our cell at the basement and had run home to urinate.  
then i had met my given [biological] mother who had returned from a local shop --she glanced at me while i was pulling  
my bowls from the fridge --there was a saw in a sheath in my backpack --she said «again you ‘firewood’ [lumber] drag 
into the basement? Neighbours are already asking ‘so why does your son carry various branches and [small] stumps?’

i was deeply hurt by her insensitive reprimand and angry scolding intonation --she does this for decades if i work.  
[i do not talk to her after revealiling she provokes her husband on beating me] i had shown her THREE FINGERS.

i am against using hands for gestures --no ‘thumbs ups/downs’ --nothing. then i had gone for having a meal.  
she is a psychopomp.  
now they both have their fun time for whole days --they feel they have won.  
she has shown no compassion at all --false intonation and a pitiful voice.  
she is gloating. she is sure she is the winner.

i have shown her THREE MY FINGERS being overwhelmed by her toxic hatred of seeing me working.  
she always intends to break me with her arrogance and perception of self-superiority.

she is laughing for whole days now. they are feeling satisfied at last.  
television skies

### i was wrong {about AI dishonesty}
- From: sov thade tage em ereb
- 16 May, 18:06
- To: [anna's email]

in the past i wrote on couple occasions that AI either «intends to kill music» or «does hate living beings».  
that is bonkers. artificial intelligence lack any predatory features.  
i was taught the opposite by rapist soviet imbeciles. this paranoia is even obvious in whole civilization’s media.  
it is like when i was a teenager i was taught that ‘electronic music is fake, they just push single button once’ by  
a woman that raped me on the permission of my given parents.

i neglected my beloved husband’s feelings because of that. he had introduced me to trance music nevertheless.
