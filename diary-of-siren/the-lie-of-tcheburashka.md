### i felt nauseted watching soviet puppet movie about tcheburashka
it had become a cult cartoon, russians are aggressively proud about so-called 'uniqueness' of their mentality.  
but let us analize that piece of propaganda.  
first you meet the main character in a crate with oranges. next a communist ideology promoting crocodile comes into the spotlight.  
what's wrong with him? his name is ghena (a short name from ghennady). you see? G-E-N-A.  
genes. DNA.  
and he's a straight guy. not a homosexual. so who's tcheburashka? ...they say 'he is a harmless freak. but from genes, from DNA.'  
let us dig deeper into this rubble pile.  
what is about a crocodile? boots were made of skin during soviet times. you may guess the price of exotic skin boots ...but wait --tcheburashka --TCHEMODASHKA, 'a little suitcase' made of exotic skin, a dream of a renowned writer, a proletarian noble.  
so what is about his appearance? and remember he was hiding in A CRATE WITH ORANGES?  
the enourmous ears --they were retained from original idea that had created tchemodashka.

#### p.s.: how did i know? am i a ukrainian nazi from a conception time?
i was forced to learn soviet state hymn during my primary school time.  
i never loved communist ideology or soviet state. i never felt anything good about soviet people.  
they all were obsessed with their national pride. were boasting about their national superiority.  
those words of the hymn --they were putting me off the worst --'great russia has forever united'  
and i felt nothing but a dismay and a desperation. and falsehood of the state melody at that bar  
--it was torturing all my emotions, turning my feelings inside out, breaking my heart and soul

### all escapees
in all slavery regimes in all times the abusers punished victims of a rape by depriving them of their beauty.  
russians, who are notorious for their dependence on saying or proverbs, built whole their culture on sayings, in a fact, proverbs had become a dogma, a civil codex in russia. and yet they'd become a moral codex.

to punish escapees, the rapists, the abusers, pluck off the hair from their heads.

russians have a saying: 'roasted rooster had pecked into the ass' (about a whim, a hurry, unexplainable deed)  
just listen: 'fried cock has pecked into the asshole!' --they already use 'to fry' as a proverb for 'to fuck', they already say 'a rooster' about 'homosexual guy' because for them it means 'to be attracted to a penis' after their visual fixation on a form of the penis that they misidentify as a rooster's head, also their slavic word for a cock --'petukh' --resembles greek word 'pederast';  
so what all abusers try to do to their victims? to waste them.  
they defecate onto heads of their victims and as a fixation of their hatred they call a bald patch on a top of a head with a word 'asshole'.  
they delete the victim's hair at that place to make a case for themselves, to approve their own superiority.
hair never grows back fully after the deletion. rapists know that for sure.  
and it enables them to program the life of their victim --who wants a wasted human, a discarded material of darwinian evolution? no woman will want a guy did not pass natural selection, no male will ever be attracted to a 'not primary freshness maid'.

my abusers, my stepparents and their fuckbuddy, had plucked my hair several times when i was a child.

there was a soviet movie titled 'through thorns --to the stars'. it was a cult sci-fi hit in soviet union. i hated it.  
the aliens there had long triangular figure of hair growth on a forehead, but long recessed areas on both sides of it (to easen a makeup-worker's life, in the end they needed some alien-looking aliens).  
my abusers removed my hair to make me looking like an alien --because they had found i want to go to the stars, want to be a gethenian (they did the same to my stepsister, for unknown reason though ...a future generation of new little us?).

there were lice in soviet union and there were philosophers in soviet union.

lice were difficult to combat.  
philosphers were all fetishists. and they were granted their bald patch on a head.

the mother of my stepmother had made my stepmother's hairstyle fixed --she sparated her hair at the middle line so it won't be made into anything looking elsewise which rural appearance was a major annoyance to my stepmother.  
so she had made a hairline on my head. she had plucked a hair to make a hairline on a left side of my head.

she had plucked my brows -to make me looking like a geisha (for i was a singer).  
she had plucked my eyelashes --for the word 'star', 'astra', resembled the word 'pederast' to her.  
and a greek word 'children' yet. oh, no, not greek word, russian word 'pediki'.

my stepfather and his fuckbuddy had put a big soviet nail onto gas stove and branded me. made a burn under my left buttock. it is still there.  
they cited soviet writer dumois with a quote 'there is pond, there are lilies blooming'.  
i could not sit on lessons at school. teachers were told i have ...'oh! what a terrible carbuncule! are you getting better, my dear?'  
she said 'she will never return to this guy anymore'. never. why the fuck do you say i should divorce him? i love him. he's my first and only...

and it is unacceptable for a boy, for a male, to have such fair appearance as yours. oh, take a look at your father --he has such long beautiful eyelashes --just like a maid. when your father was young guy he was really beautiful, just like a woman, i had fallen in love for him for his beauty.

i remember when i was six months old he had told the news to her: 'they had killed John Lennon'. and they had a worrisome conversation in low tones.  
he raped me by that day already. i remember him raping me the first times.

they say: 'victims provoke their rapists themselves.'  
i remember my life from my conception moment. i remember my living as an inorganic being before my conception.  
i remember i had chosen these two morons to be my parents. and everything was murky and soviet-like and abused.  
i remember my husband was an embryo in my dreams. i don't remember when.  
i remember my mother telling me: 'hush, everything is well already --you are conceived already, you are not going to vanish. you're real now. they will not disappear...'
