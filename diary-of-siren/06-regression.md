actually, i CAN do it, but only if singing a song including a spoken word or a rapping

once when i was 18y.o or 19y.o. (or possibly 16y.o.) me and my 4 years yonger given sister were in our room while my given mother was nearby at the kitchen. the door was opened, but it is impossible to look into our room from the kitchen.  
we were sitting on her bed, a first store of two‑store bed. after sudden impulse i have loudly said with my sister’s slightly breathy voice: "Mama!"  
my given sister was staring at me with a shocked gaze.  
"What is it, Olya?" echoed mother;  
```
i wanna be a secret
or at least its keeper
i wanna be a pearl
or at least its shell
```
"Uh, what you doing?" i asked her;  
and she replied: "Cooking the meal, so what?"  
and then my sister had managed to speak: "Mama! It is him!"  
"What 'Him'?" asked mother;  
"I am Olya, i am talking to you" i had replied;  
"No, mama, it is him speaking! Stop mocking!"  
"No, i am Olya!" continued me with her voice.  
"Don’t believe him! I am Olya!"  

then when we had come to the kitchen mother could not believe that was me talking.

when i was 14y.o. i was forced to stop speaking with my natural soprano voice.  
my classmate with whom we often hang out for daylong had declared an ultimatum: "You speak like a lass. Speak as a guy [muzhik]! Oh, you cannot? So learn it, or fuck off!"

as i can recollect he and his older close friend had held a counsel on issue of my femininity.

he bullied me into it. on most classes we shared a desk, so when i behaved in my natural feminine manner or spoke in soprano he bounced me to my forearm. i had bruises easily.  
"Fuck off" he said, or "Say it as a man [muzhik]!"  
or ignored me.  
older boys mocked me and laughed at us:
"They had said him he’s a girl, now he behaves like a lass."

i had found fry register and used this trick, even forgetting i was fooling them, until i have lost my soprano voice irreversibly at the age of 16, when a mutation has occured, and in a day my speaking voice had changed to fry register forever.

at this point neither me nor my husband Timmo nor our lover Helen remembered what we had together before.  
we had forgotten our promise to reunite after i would be changed to a gethenian species.  
no one cared we have married, people visited us or made orgies ...it was totally fine for them.  
someone had spreaded a rumour that i beat Timmo and interrupt our lovemaking.  
a moment before we forgot, Timmo sat behind me in a class, and his face was just becoming looking well again. guys had beaten him badly several times, they told "Active fag must have his beating for his role in their fake marriage".  
i had broken our relationship. i had intended it so. but before taking away their memory by beating Timmo i had promised them to become their lover again after the transition.  
in a threesome we learned to do Foretelling. i was their Weaver.  
i am not sure about their roles then, humans cannot participate in a Foretelling.  
aside of alcohol abuse and of being abused by others we had grave issue. i had lost my mind and had begun beating Timmo to stop that bad mistaken activity our rapists taught us.  
and i react to alcohol not like anyone else does.  
i cannot get drunk in way others do.  
i have invincible instincts.  
i am anti‑social.

i want to say this: "Love needs to be proved, Timmo. If you would not return while i am having human genome, you would lose me forever"
