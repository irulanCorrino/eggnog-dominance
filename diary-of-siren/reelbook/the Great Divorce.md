the Great Divorce is an enormous wheel standing upright above every place at planet Earth. its pleasure cabins may pick you from a street in russia and lift you to an oceania island then to britain and at the top you will be meeting you beloved ones being abused or forced to vicious activity by some random men exerting their right on a patriarchal one night stand.  
neurosurgeons and organ traffickers will sift through your dreaming.  
your love will be reduced to a cute eye-candy sponge on a penis of a patriarch.  
through the smell of the nutmeg you will get yourself disintegrated into a thin fog then hijackers will turn you into a rose cherished by a terror syndicate.  
sing they say to you.  
you will be raped and your lover will not recognize you.  
your singing does not need any brain. you are a siren.  
cabins will descend deeper in the sky while passing by tropical beaches and ugly city streets where all sorts of drug dealers will haunt your beloved ones for getting a profit from them.  
your broken life is changed by a true love of a spouse recognizing you in a form of the singing rose. your love discards the rape and memories of it.  
your beloved ones are trying to return you to your original form. and you are not a brainless flower anymore.  
nutmeg is flushed off of your blood.  
you are still unable to get asleep.  
your cabin descends through infidelities to places where you and your spouses are able to free from your abusers.  
armed they hide on higher levels of the ever descending and ascending wheel.  
you are dumped onto uncanny street among urban mess.  
you are one.
