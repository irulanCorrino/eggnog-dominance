##### Picture: the City

then he will spend for a charity  
to recover  
to be ever looking as a charitable person  
to be forgiven  
will disguise himself for an intellectual  
with slow turns of complexity  
of his intents  
to make the case for the retards  
to turn everyone into a retard  
to earn the admiration  
he'll be forgiven for his intents  

his failure will become an irresistable pervertion  
the success up to be slashed for greater fortune  
to recover  
with slow turns of an intellectual person  
recuperate the cost  
of the moral failure  

he's agonising now

his pride is hurt

he's trying to slay his son and heir  
but there is no one to comply  
his life was illusory like his issue  
futile and vain  
so he denies his heir  
the success up to be slayn for the greater fortune  
an irresistable pervertion  
to recover his pride is hurt
