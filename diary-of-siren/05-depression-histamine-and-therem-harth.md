## major depression
```
you’re all mistaken
mother can’t you see?
i was not taken
—mother i took to leave
```
11 hours ago i was hit by worsened symptoms of major depression.  
i was writting a diary page `04-regression.md` when after switching  
to youtube.com my smartphone’s `Chrome Beta` had lost my GitHub  
input data ...so that i saw empty new page instead of completed diary page.  

that morning some five or six hours before i had taken 10mg of Loratadine.  
it is first time i am taking this medication but i took diazoline  
many times before when i was a teenager (or untill the year-23rd-ago).  
i am very sensitive to histamine —i was only one from whole my (given)  
family who was affected after eating a couple of pieces of tuna meat  
(i say 'given', i have refused to be their relative). my lumps were giant  
but i had had no asphyxiation and my given parents (both were  
physicians) were very concerned and had given me diazoline  
[it was at 19y.o. or maybe 20y.o.]  
and i had identical reaction after several applications of Griseofulvine  
on my palms when i was younger. my given sister [we share genetic makeup]  
had no allergy to this drug [or tuna’s meat].  

this morning i was outside at 11.30am, and the weather was hot,  
so i was tired a little [and i was singing, it is a load too].  
then i had a meal (standing for more than hour) and a difficult  
conversation about misdiagnosed cases of omicron with my given mother  
[she interrupts Google Translator and that upsets me always].  

after losing my edit on GitHub [it was a trouble even to use its editor]  
i have perceived heavy drowsiness and gotten a visionary i usually  
have in the scan mode.  
tears had appeared in my left eye.  
i have said waking up: 'i shall die and then every one else will die...'  
and fallen asleep again.  
waking up and then falling asleep recurrently i was like:  
'i shall die and all souls will die...'  
'...i shall die and all beings living inside of me will die'  
'Universe will die'  
'i shall die childless'  
'i shall die childless and unaloved'  
'no one loves me'  
'i do not want to die —i want to live forever'  
'i shall die unaloved and my soul will die'  
and last time i remember i was like:  
'Sunny, i love you —i shall never see you again'  
and i was sobbing without tears at times.  

after 8 hours of sleep (making for 22 hour cycle) i have woke up  
at night without symptoms of major depression.  

## Therem Harth rem ir Estraven
Zera Archer, with whom i had a two week long affair at summer 2005,  
had an allergy on a pollen. she took Claritin for this condition.  
i met Zera in 2001 (yes, we were at college when `9/11 attacks`  
had happened, we were not allowed go home and maybe listened radio)  

when we were alone in a room that summer she suddenly had said:  
'i am probably a schizophrenic'  
i replied: 'no, you are not a schizophrenic!'  
then (or maybe little later) she has said:  
'no, you don’t know, i am such a trash ['thug'] —i have instigated  
a quarrel between one girl and her husband...'  
'no, you are not a trash ['thug'] at all at all, don’t say this!..'  
'no, i am a thug, you don’t know what me is —a thug...' —she said.  
'no, don’t say this, it’s not true, you are not as such'  
'oh [my_name], you are so naive, you don’t understand...  
you’re so good, and i’m a trash...  
[gonna freak our of that]'  

then after our (and Ashe’s —her widowed sister’s) relationships have  
turned bad she had said during their confrontational moment with me:  
'why are you allowed to have several girls, but me is not allowed  
to have several boys?'  
i kept silent to this her attempt to pick me.  


## H1 inhibitors cause major depression and unmotivated behavior
```
Loratadine is said to be a non‑drowsiness drug for most patients, but
some people may be sensitive to it
```

Zera Archer lives on this drug. we are not lovers anymore.  
she has replied to me:  
'but i don’t love you'  
and her sister Aishe has said the same.  
```
women, you know, they copy other womens’ estimation  
of a potential erotical partner.  

```
- Zera, 1984
- Aishe, 1980
- Zoila, 1980

they said me that Aishe’s husband had commited a suicide, he was on heroin; she had 2.5y.o child when we had become lovers
