[<img title="mmm, yes, people are worried about their 'LITTLE THEMSELVES'. why do they defame me?" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/TMrrz8uScN8/maxresdefault.jpg" width="80%">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrrz8uScN8)

üå®is living in Crimea. this dumb civilization lies in every minute of their lives. if not so --why after just TEN years of russian occupation do some 99% of crimean children and teenagers hate Ukraine and ukrainians?  
what number is that? 1.5mln? no? ok, continue calculating --before the invasion (in 2014) 99% of THEN UKRAINIAN citizens living in this village hated A SINGLE PERSON, defaming her, smearing her life with dirt.  
i am an intersex person. i make an equality sign between both nations. the condition returns 'true' --patriarchality is the real evil, you cannot hide it behind your hypocritical social engineering or fake sociological reports.  
you all hate a single person, no matter if you're a ukrainian or martian. you're arrogant soulless atheists, concerned with survival of your patriarchs, not seeing the Mother created us all.  
yeah, go and call me a schizophrenic --there are no national differences between all you doing that!!!  
since this moment, after you had posted this piece of industrial rubble i stop watching ANYTHING related to your local patriarchal war, anything related to your society of bigots and meat eaters.  
God damn you;üë≠üíï‚ùÑ
