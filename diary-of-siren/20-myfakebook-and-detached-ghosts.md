### our honeymoon
in 2002 when i was 22 i was on a trip to a seashore with "a bride" of the man whom i met when i was 7 and who is 5 days older then me. i had married him when he proposed me after i was diagnosed with de la chapelle syndrome (at 12 or 14, i cannot recollect our exact age at that moment).  
in that trip i was gifted a plain grey linnen skirt, basically, a cloth with attached string of the same linnen. that woman, anne, had given it to me when after i had broken my promise to quit tobacco smoking and picked a leftover cigarette from a pavement i had soiled my only trouser.  
the trip had begun just a week before my birthday in the end of may and i guess two months later i was sitting on a cliff in the same village and i was playing my new alto flute.  
now i understand she is the first gossiwor. she still has only the first tone hole at semitone position and starting with that one they should make a phrygian scale (2nd one is plus a semitone and so on).  
i was playing with my eyes closed and Sun was shining through my eyelids. i saw vivid colors. it has begun with a bright red and faded into the deep blue. i had played for a half of an hour or more and opened the eyes because i was very excited.  
everything was light blue. everyone was blue (i mean trees and herbs and rocks were blue too).

it lasted for a minute i guess.

i saw myself blue as well.

### my experience as a prose writer

<div align="center">PREREQUISITES:</div>
<div align="center">"People do not read that much nowadays. They prefer watching videos";</div>
<div align="center">"James Morrison was a voracious reader"</div>

i tried to write a fictionalised autobiography in a style of Stephen Baxter-inspired fan-fiction.  
i did not read his books back then, however, just a wikipedia article series. i had failed with my own attempt.

there were interesting images or literary devices but as a whole piece the book has failed, particularly because it was started from a concept of a fan-fiction piece.  
you can see the rudiments of that book when hovering with a mouse pointer over my github avatar --it says a weiqi moves sequence.  
i am not going to detail on the storyline or organisation of that work here but i want to use it as a reflection on my relationship with the woman i have mentioned at the first chapter of this page --anna.

i had painted her as an art lawyer but she was kinda historian of art by education. she was a painter herself but she never tried it seriously, instead, she used that as an art therapy.

[<img align="right" title="Lisa Schiff case analysis" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/LGNrKc8ywuU/maxresdefault.jpg" width="40%">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGNrKc8ywuU)

i had a very strange relationship with ann.  
now i have watched Dr. Todd Grande's analysis of an art adviser Lisa Schiff who comitted $6mln wire fraud and i have found a disturbing similarity to my relationship with ann, except instead of money our case involved personal attention or intimate feelings.

honestly, i am not a supporter of any kind of psychological theory, i even say that any attempt of studying the soul is a libel. nevertheless, i watch such videos from time to time and some people doing this work are decent ones.

i am not going to tell that my ex-lover was like the woman described in this analysis video, no, she was mistaken and manipulated, not abusive.  
but she was detached.  
she stole erotical sensation instead of money; i understand, she was really confused after i had shown her my affecton, even though her intimate friend, who was my husband when we were teenagers, had introduced her to me as his bride (at the time of the events described we both were not aware we were married ten years before).

when we were on that trip to the seashore with ann, she had picked some local guy who was flirting with her and even allowed him to grope her, people told that their affair had gone even hotter than just groping but i was too hurt to listen to peoples' reports or opinions.  
at some point, it was a beginning of our disastrous break up, she had left our bed and had joined that guy who was waiting for her while lying on a floor; there were other people in the room, and that bed was not our spousal bed but a shared bed, a younger teenage boy shared it with us two ...so you see, she had the reasons to be confused about our relationship, even be mad on me for showing my affection publicly (i am very emotional and impulsive, or may smother with feeling shyly).  
she motivated her misleading and treacherous behaviour with her buddist self-realisation path, even becoming a target for peoples' mockery or direct insults (like "a teacher of tantra" oor "a disciple of tantrism", in a meaning of "sacred promiscuity").  
i should be alarmed long before that diastrous sequence of events, before our departure from timmo's home, at the very first time when she had replied him "please, don't" ["please, stop it"] after he told me she was his bride.  
they had become intimate exactly a year before, in the early spring time, when she had come from st. petersburg to simferopol for moving to a seashore while there are no pesky tourists, they had spent some nights together before she had left him for a year. she had spent the remainder of her money to buy him a CD player (that was quiet a precious gift, even a treasuure, because he was a trance DJ; he was robbered and he had lost it together with his audio library, probably he was beaten yet). he told me that year, a year before i had met her myself "move in with me; i had met such a little human, so wonderful one --i want to introduce her to you; i had fallen in love again ...so heavily, don't know what to do; move in with me --you won't regret it ...when anya will return you will find how beautiful she is, i am sure, you will like her very". and then she had turned him down abruptly and mockingly.  

she told me --she had a boyfriend long ago, when she was a teenager. he had left her and first she was inconsolable, then turned to psychology and "self-therapy", then to buddism and now had become a celibate. but you know, all the ideology and whole objective behind celibacy can be compared to objectives of those women going to ISIS training camps "to become temporary wives of martyrs" --yes, it sounds destroying one's self-esteem, and it is intened for that --a frivolous ideation of consoling masculine objects by providing temporary relief from heavy loads is abhorring.

after dropping me behind she had left that local man from seashore resort village and found herself some jobs: a housekeeper for MMF threesome or a cook in a private hostel --everywhere she had some male chums with whom she started close relationships and some ended disastrously for her as i know.  
and yes --"she visited Turkey recently, upon the return she lived here with a guy by the name Valerik --he's her husbands and..." [she had send me a postcard after that trip, yet citing sufies "[...] come to us to destroy ugly image of existance[...]" and so on, but no word about "Valerik" who once, meeting me alone on a seashore, asked me "are you with Anna now? we were starting together some time ago --tell me, what [kind of person] is she now? i want to restore our relationship"].

she never returned either to me or to my timmo.  
gives kisses to everyone and nipples to tease
