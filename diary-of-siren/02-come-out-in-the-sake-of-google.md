## <div align="center"> "Come Out For Google Sake!"</div>


<div align="center"><ins>google is the biggest fraud to linux</ins></div>  

if google’s search engine is what has made them famous then i am very sure their fans are imbecilic.  
this morning i tried to search for info on **two moms pushing their preteen sons to have gay relationship type of friendship**.  
and do you know with what `Quick Search` answered to my request?  
yes! you are a psychic! `what it means living with two moms` —20‑ish top results; `[PDF] Helping LGBTQ+ teens in their coming out` —40‑ish results.  

<div align="center"><ins>my earliest memories about my husband</ins></div>  

when i was 7y.o., i guess, that is in second grade [a Soviet‑style school] or maybe as late as in 9y.o. [that’s `stone‑hard` unlikely] i have met Timmo, my future husband.  
i guess he has changed his school, probably when his parents had divorced [or maybe his father had fled]. 
i am not sure —i have changed the school for sure —i had problems in first grade and that school was somewhat far.  
maybe he had not come from another school, but only me had.  

anyway here is that moment i first saw him. 
me and Timmo and my [given] mother and his mother were walking down a village road to my house, a dormitory, Timmo and his mother had a private house in next block.  
this road, where we were walking then, is rebuilt into a street and hosts a mosque now. it has happened when we were 17.  
i was not aware of the surroundings in the way you, most of the people, do —i virtually was unware of Timmo’s existence before this day, and he was going hand by hand with me, so handsome and quiet.  
i do not remember much but our [given] mothers had decided for us to become friends. effectively they have pushed us into a gay relationship.  
i must to say that that idea was promoted by my given parents and their friend, a male swinger, not by Timmo’s mother.  

i vaguely can remember my given mother saying "Don’t be shy, kiss [your new friend]!" or something like that.  
i cannot see far enough. i always had such type of sight. she didn’t know it until i was 14 i guess.  
i do not think they have a right to decide for us.  
i still love Timmo.  
i am not interested in other men but Timmo.  
he has forgotten everything and last words i heard from him were: "come with us, you will not regret; you will be fun, i promise".  
it was 1st of January 2005, i guess, i was going to buy myself a bottle of kefir and Timmo was standing drunk on a street in my block next to a car with guys from his drug gang.  
they all are the best men i know.  
but i do not drink alcohol. i hate it.  
i have refused.  

and you know, my given parents did not know i am a woman. a genetic research team had announced this to our class when we were 14.  
my given parents had not believed it. neither parents, nor teachers were invited by the research team.  
then when Timmo have married me they have broken our marriage accusing us in immorality and indecency.  
but that had happened only after **other dwellers of Twin Peaks, very important locals, had become aware** of our marriage.  
before Twin Peaks had known about us, we were celebrated in our families as a prodigy gay couple.  
they literally put us in their beds.  
so Twin Peaks had become jelous and had intervened.  
with all the tragic consequences, usually brought by locals of Twin Peaks.
