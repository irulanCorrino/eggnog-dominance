i have such ethical views that do not allow me sharing of some specific private data.  
i mean being a Weaver i can influence the Future and i have to exert great care on what i do and who i am.
for example i have a crash on two beings of human species what may be either an explicit attraction or a required desire.  
that is —it may be destructive for our nature in first case but in second case the survival of our biological species may depend on deep emotional bonds between me and those two humans even though we cannot conceive children together.  
and i do not mean sharing resources or working together would save our species, no, that is not social value ...but an emotional value.  
the Reality hears us, our behavior or personal traits make us living or killing ourselves.
