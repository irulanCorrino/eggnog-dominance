### our honeymoon
in 2002 when i was 22 i was on a trip to a seashore with "a bride" of the man whom i met when i was 7 and who is 5 days older then me. i had married him when he proposed me after i was diagnosed with de la chapelle syndrome (at 12 or 14, i cannot recollect our exact age at that moment).  
in that trip i was gifted a plain grey linnen skirt, basically, a cloth with attached string of the same linnen. that woman, anne, had given it to me when after i had broken my promise to quit tobacco smoking and picked a leftover cigarette from a pavement i had soiled my only trouser.  
the trip had begun just a week before my birthday in the end of may and i guess two months later i was sitting on a cliff in the same village and i was playing my new alto flute.  
now i understand she is the first gossiwor. she still has only the first tone hole at semitone position and starting with that one they should make a phrygian scale (2nd one is plus a semitone and so on).  
i was playing with my eyes closed and Sun was shining through my eyelids. i saw vivid colors. it has begun with a bright red and faded into the deep blue. i had played for a half of an hour or more and opened the eyes because i was very excited.  
everything was light blue. everyone was blue (i mean trees and herbs and rocks were blue too).

it lasted for a minute i guess.

i saw myself blue as well.
