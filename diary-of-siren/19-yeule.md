### our honeymoon
in 2002 when i was 22 i was on a trip to a seashore with "a bride" of the man whom i met when i was 7 and who is 5 days older then me. i had married him when he proposed me after i was diagnosed with de la chapelle syndrome (at 12 or 14, i cannot recollect our exact age at that moment).  
in that trip i was gifted a plain grey linnen skirt, basically, a cloth with attached string of the same linnen. that woman, anne, had given it to me when after i had broken my promise to quit tobacco smoking and picked a leftover cigarette from a pavement i had soiled my only trouser.  
the trip had begun just a week before my birthday in the end of may and i guess two months later i was sitting on a cliff in the same village and i was playing my new alto flute.  
now i understand she is the first gossiwor. she still has only the first tone hole at semitone position and starting with that one they should make a phrygian scale (2nd one is plus a semitone and so on).  
i was playing with my eyes closed and Sun was shining through my eyelids. i saw vivid colors. it has begun with a bright red and faded into the deep blue. i had played for a half of an hour or more and opened the eyes because i was very excited.  
everything was light blue. everyone was blue (i mean trees and herbs and rocks were blue too).

it lasted for a minute i guess.

i saw myself blue as well.

- i was three years old. there were me and my stepfather [nominally my biological father] in the room. i don't remember if my stepmother [nominally my biological mother] was there or not
  - he had put a window's sheer lace curtain over [an illegaly made, i suppose] open spiral heater to proudly impress me with a cosy feeling he was feeling about his own authority
  - he pretended 'to be as silly as a little child' while communicating with me
  - he had begun raping me before i was six months old --i remember at the time when John Lennon was killed, my stepfather raped me already
  - his name is Yura
    - i could not produce `<r>` consonant until i was six or seven i guess
    - but i do not remember if i was blaiming him to her for doing this fire
    - and maybe he himself had begun saying his name in that childish manner to mock me
  - i remember he had falsely accused me before her for moving the curtain and causing the fire
- probably my stepmother was cooking at the kitchen when the fire had started at the bedroom
  - maybe when fire had begun he had exited the room or was dumb enough to call her instead of stopping the fire
  - or maybe he had left me there before the curtain had ignited, but it is the least possible version of the events
- i guess after that fire incident they had begun calling me Yulya, but maybe they had begun doing it earlier
  - i remember he said 'Yulka put the curtain onto the heater' or 'Yulka had [done something] and had run away'
  - and she said 'Yulya is [or was] a half year older to your' or 'Yulya was much more active than you, always started mischievous things'
  - and after that her '20250217 interview' ([look previous chapter](Yeule)) i had recollected she herself tried to learn singing, not that like Yulya's mother was a musician or a music teacher; she sang Alla Poo-gacheva's songs and alikes. i remember she told her husband she was banned from singing as a child by her father to not to draw the attention of soviet authorities and her parents told she had no musical capabilities; she compared herself to her husband 'who was a very intimate and proficient singer on his own because his mother studied music professionally' --but that was a rubbish because both him and his mother lacked any musicality and could not hear C from D. then she had failed to learn soviet songs and had become even more toxic bigot
- a year later, when i was four, my stepsister was born ...they had called her Olya
- i guess i can even recollect my stepmother saying 'it is over, Yulya will not come again'. i was utterly destroyed when they had stripped me off of my name
