#### Die Deutschland ist meine zweite Mutterland
i am not of purely Scythian [Ukrainian] descendance but my stepmother[^1] is of half-German origin --her mother was a Ukrainian and her father was a German [my stepfather[^1] is of a Ukrainian origin].

Hans Just was my only relative taking me seriously. he was an experienced surgeon [i am against this], he was very solemn and even shy a bit. he spoke in German fluently and was bent on reading. he was a devoted Catholic (i guess, or maybe a Lutheran).  
his devotion to Jesus saved me from atheist or other transgressions a lot throughout my life.  
but he was not my grandfather. this biological parental relation was invalidated by my upcoming transformation to a different biological species. this is my destiny. i saw it while being in my stemother's womb.

and he was my ex-lover. he had a wife[^2] so he felt cheating on her and yet he was tortured by his concepts of a sin of sexual deviation and together those factors poisoned our relationship.  
and he was older than me. i broke the generation congruence nuptial rule by falling for him. but in a light of my transformation this rule gets imprecise or distorted. my biological species is an ancestor to all three other species of men. God herself is of Ynnwn.  
nevertheless i felt [and i still feel] deeply wrong about our amourette. but i never was a male. i never understood his sensation of committing a sin.

when he was dying he called for me in his death visions. he did not said a word about me aloud, i mean, but his wife found him dead in his bed at morning, i heard it in a dreaming through hundreds kilometers between us, i mean.  
i saw this later (or real-time) in my dreaming where i saw a bathhouse-like or subway-like corridor with ceramic tiles on the walls, but i did not see anyone there, only heard a desperate crying "Pavlik, Pavlik, Pavlik..." going down and down the cold endless stairways and repeating forever. repeating with a true fear which i am not able to feel myself, only as a feeling coming from someone else.  
no pain, no fear. that was a female voice.  
a feeling of being betrayed and rejected resonated behind his fear of death. people mistreated him and they took violent actions to punish him for our amourette.  
i feel deep sorrow in his death weepings. immense loneliness.  
for sometimes recollecting the dreaming i mistook his voice for a voice of a Ukrainian woman lived next to his house, but now i am sure i heard his tone of voice, but feminine[^3].

#### next chancellor of Germany
next chancellor of Germany will be Alice Weidel.  
i am not an economist, not even close [my husband had a university education in this field]. but i feel that even though i hate money, we are deeply into this already so we have to deal with it. i understand nothing about politics or commerce but Alice's intents are genuine, i can feel it seeing her face, listening to her voice.  
i am emotionally touched with her, an ideology or mode of reasoning are quiet irrelevant for me in this choice.

[^1]: normatively called my biological parent; my step-parents had lost their biological parental relation to me after various reasons (abuse, my transformation into a different species, their rejection of their own ancestry and the aligning themselves with so-called "russians")
[^2]: she was a soviet communist and he had taken her from "official soviet brothel" --a mass-entertainment department where she was working as a part-time singer (or maybe she was a factory worker yet, not sure); she constantly cheated on him with her friends and even strangers, both males and females; she had an immense influence on my stepmother whom she sexually abused
[^3]: i have a recurrent dream of this type for myself. i am at a great hill with a very steep slope. sometimes there is water beneath [i cannot swim and had several dangerous moments in my life].  
i try to stop tumbling or sliding down. to fall into the dark empty fog beneath me would mean an irreversible death.  
i do not remember, probably during my imprisonment, for some months i saw myself as a kinda wasp living inside of flat stone on a hillside. there were many such dwellings around and we all were like a pebble in outer space under the Sun.  
i was used for seeing other worlds. Sunshine Wasps cared for their homes and worked in their little gardens with all the pretty flowers.  
some Humans joined us as our spouses yet.  
the wasps kept the dwellings from collapsing into deadly fog beneath. at times there was no dark gray death fog around us and we were young happy and beautiful.  
i gave birth to my daughters and they left the hive in a search of new worlds. we were young Sunshine Wasps finding our beautiful new flat stones transformed into houses.  
we were deeply hurt and lonely after our children left us for searching a new cluster of stones.  
we were getting old and ill or sometimes some of our spouses were abducted by roaming Human tribes who were against us and our Human spouses.  
but then our spouses appeared again and we were young happy and beautiful
