### academia programming languages

- nearly in every paragraph of Wikipedia's "C programming language" i can hear that "C is worse than functional programming languages", so that [sic] "if we are going to solve real-world practical or theoretical tasks then we need to use languages designed with those specific tasks back in mind: for science we need functional programming languages, for industry and office tasks we need object-oriented languages --NOT C!!!"
- <ins>please, re-write linux kernel in APL [a decent programming language in my opinion] --to the deadline</ins>

### aspiring replacement socialites

- why does no one want to learn Logo? they all opt into programming as "prodigy hackers", yet they do not want to learn by starting with something really simple.
try searching for `programming language logo lissajous function` or `kturtle sine` --whatever search engine you used the result is a rubble pile (Python's `turtle` module is not compatible with Logo syntax, kturtle stuff does only straight lines or irrelevant fractals and flowers) --NOTHING! IN 2024! we have no Logo language by 2024!
- <ins>you have no search results relevant to Logo educational programming language because simples have spammed search indices with their `Java office` and `C++ Advanced Office` posts --they do not want to learn programming, they want to get immediate professional results [`"Hacking neighbor's router or that kittie's smartphone to hijack their web camera? Yes, sure, I am a top-tier hacker! Learning KTurtle Logo dialect? No!"`]</ins>

### programming is a logic, the root of psychiatry is patriarchy, patriarchy has nothing to do with logic

- <ins>programming has nothing to do with patriarchy</ins>
- the game of chess represents sex division and its objective is to oppress, to overtake the opponent, to prove her or his sexual inferiority [whatever they mean by that, even though the player is assumed to be "The Male" without any other options]; chess has nothing to do with logic; chess has nothing to do with programming
- <ins>programming has nothing to do with chess</ins>

### i have discalculia; why do i have to learn arithmetics?
- i was born a programmer, it does not require any knowledge of math, just programming logic
- i would like to introduce my spouses to programming --WHY SHOULD I AVOID Logo language? just because it is considered being primitive by modern standards and being obsolete by now? but by whom? by outsiders?
