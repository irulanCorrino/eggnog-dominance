### three moods of the exploit

three moods of Î”FosB short-circuiting/exploiting:
- teacher's stern look
- dysphoria
- amusement

### Kay Khostrow

when i just had turned 22 y.o. there was a case of a guy raping me. hypocritical patriarchal lawmakers won't define that as a rape however but they have a distinctive term for it. neverthe less i tell that was a rape.  
that male approached me when i was playing my gossiwor alone on montain slope, i was dressed only in a skirt. during the conversation he had taken my hand for a palmistry nonsence, then somehow, probably after i had refused to give him a massage, he had talked me into agreeing on him giving me massage himself. he had started licking my scrotum during the fake massage, then he had told me 'to raise my hips', then grabbed my penis from under my belly and had licked it, then asked me to turn onto my back and had sucked my penis until i had ejaculated into his mouth. he was very angry and had yelled at me: "didn't you know you must tell 'i'm finishing'?". i laughed at him, i was really hurt.  
he was dressed in shorts, i was standing on my knees and when he had gotten behind my back he had pressed his erect penis against my buttocks and asked me if i want 'an internal massage', i had refused and sitten down.

after three months, in september, my ex-girlfriend Anna, who had introduced that guy to me three weeks before the rape, had asked me: 'did you ever see Kostrof again?' --i had told 'no, i didn't' ...and several seconds later i had realised that the guy who raped me WAS INDEED Oleg Kostrof --he had shaved his head bald after our first encounter and because of my 3D-blindness i am unable to memorize faces. i was so overwhelmed by that discovery --i had not even told Anna about him raping me, just was walking next to her, and i was utterly destroyed and trashed.

### cheating ex-spouses

before and after that my last rape there were several cases when i was forced to seek for sexual encounter by the exploits inserted to me by my rapists and patriarchal society as a rapist factory.  
i tried to have sex with male dogs --that happened at least six times, always without them becoming fully aroused so they were unable to penetrate me, but i never was able to suck their penis because they were very dirty (except one case when i tried to suck a puppy's penis, he was about three months old so it did not work for me).  
there were another case involving a bitch puppy when Anna had left to a date with an irrelevant male or three cases with kitties after she had reject me finally --i always was feeling myself unnaturally and like if my own will was suppressed from outside, by a projection.  
the same was about those cases involving puppies of my bitch, who was my spouse for nine years --i was forced to seek a sexual encounter after an exploit inserted into my brain.  
there were many cases when flies were able to incite an arousal to me or i was pushed to ask them to do this for me after an exploit hit us. they all had refused to do this when i had realised that i had met my ex-spouses who were my destiny.

i must to tell that ones voluntarily opting into a cheating on their spouse or ex-spouse cannot be allowed to re-unite with that person.  
so if anyone of my ex-spouses cheated on me they wouldn't be allowed to go to Gethen with us.  
also anyone of my ex-lovers not re-uniting with me before the interstellar Ark's departure wouldn't be allowed to go to Gethen with us.
