## Prologue
i was reading Stephen Baxter's "Lieserl" now and i have decided to refuse to continue with reading it.  
he had made it as an atheist's point of view.

i had a book draft based on his imagery of photino birds and a woman modified by nanobots, but did never read his books yet.  
it is impossible to rework the draft of my book to exclude his influence.  
maybe i would discontinue that project. anyhow if keeping it active it needs a thorough rewrite because of other issues.

#### Penelope
before yesterday i saw a dreaming in which some dozen of teenage boys gathered under our balcony as suitors or thieves. they were able to get into our flat just walking uphill to our third floor because the ground was connected to the balcony.  
before going to sleep i was considering making a post on my wall but after i saw that dreaming i had felt that it would be a total waste of my relationships with my ex-lovers.  
with that up to be made post i was intending to attack muslims in a response to their allies russians throttling youtube in a last move before the complete ban.  
i saw the guys gathering at our balcony and they intended robbering and beating me or raping me. i saw them imagining me telling them to go away or i would call the police and when my [given] father was up to appear to the noise they were imagining me forcing them out from the balcony or hissing on them to get away while he has not begun fighting or called the police.

after i had waken up i had recollected how empty their eyes and face were. they were animals pretending on their curiousity intercourse. they were fashists entitled on patriarchal property ownership.  
i was their property, a thing of curious bodily design, a sex toy, a slave whose belongings may be alienated by their entitlement rights.  
i was expected to be a giver. they were searching for a woman to fuck but were dumbed finding an intersex person.  
they were entitled to alienate my woman from me by their fashist patriarchal laws.

i was going to post my verse "i cannot bear your children but i can bring you the stars" on my wall and probably to add something like "'Ynnwn are born without hymen because on Winter we do not have rape, our Amha created us so.' Lieserl, Project 'Snowflake Ark'".

then today i have realized that such revelation may put my supporters, me and my ex-lovers into harm's way.  
because it is so unrestrained and touching suppressed topics of the female genitalia and the fucking.

it is the biggest threat to the life --the boys are raised as entitled to a rape.  
they are up to turn into animal-like humans if getting a confirmation of their right to rape girls.

#### Rebirth or Reversal
- `generation counter` is a restricted signed pointer given some <ins>sane value</ins> in an approximate range from unsigned integer size on negative side to unsigned long long size on positive side [maybe less or more, depending on capabilities of a system and lifetime of universe and many other considerations]
- the `generation pointer` points to a `generation identifier` object which may be any label designating a `generation` including the value of `generation pointer` itself
- nullth `generation` is `slacker` in a range of -6 years and +6 years from AD 1980, the birth year of Weaver Meshe (known as Lieserl for human species); this is the point from which a default value of `generation counter` for any living person is calculated with the `generation` step of 12 years
  - a `generation identifier` is applied to a polygamous group where it is assigned adaptively so that a difference between birth year of oldest spouse and youngest spouse in a given group does not exceed 12 years; such adaptivity makes the `generation identifier` being independent from a factual birth date: for two different polygamous groups where group A has youngest member born AD 1992 and oldest one born AD 1980 while group B has youngest member born AD 1984 and oldest one born AD 1975 the `generation identifier` of all members group A would have +1 greater value then that of group B.
- `generation counter` spawns for newly populated worlds creating new relative `generation` tables, for marriages between dwellers of two different planets becoming possible their respective relative `generation` tables must be synchronised in absolute time relating to the generation `slacker` or to their nearest common ancestor world's table
  - 'synchronised in absolute time' here means `no skip no offset` system: hybernation periods[^1] are not offset onto the relative `generation` tables to prevent a conflation (aliasing) of `generation counter` values AND they are not skipped but added to physical age of the person to become an irrelevant 'phantom' age
    - lets say world Earth sends two arks with persons of the same `generation identifier` simultaneously to worlds A and B; the time in hybernation spent by dwellers of ark A is seven thousand years and for dwellers of ark B that is twelve thousand years; now `no offset` means that the `generation` with relative number 1[^2] leaving world A for world B IS STILL the `generation` with relative number 1 on the world B and[^3] the `generation` with relative number 6 coming next from world A IS STILL the `generation` with relative number 6 at the world B so they cannot become spouses to the `generation` with relative number 2 born from first settlers from world A even if they traveled fast enough
- `generation counter` for an individual person is valid only for continuos living
  - `age reversal` or 'reincarnation after the death' resets the `generation counter` to the current default `generation counter` if given person is not married[^4] but it resets to a `generation identifier` of person's spouses otherwise
  - `rebirth` or 'transformation' does not reset the `generation identifier` but the definition of the transition is 'wild' --a person may be downgraded during transformation significantly --in a tragic accident cases even lose neural tissues [or their viability] completely, as long as person is alive `generation counter` is valid

i had posted a graffiti giveaway notice on a pub's wall after my injury. i promised my guitar to Therem and my basses to Timmo. i said "please come to take care of this beauties"  
there were two youtube links

several days ago my given parents had found a slug in their room, she slept in a flower pot for months probably

two days ago i was returning home after a shopping and a walk and i saw a teenage couple hugging next to our apartment block in the dark. i had turned music in my player off merely seconds ago ...the girl said in a quiet voice: "Pederast", her boyfriend chuckled.  
next second her phone had rung and apparently she was calming her mother saying she has already come (i am in a doubt on authenticity of this event, they could wait for me returning from a walk).  
then they had followed me, i heard guy saying quietly at my back: "Leave!" ["Drive away!" in russian, meaning i must leave to UK or US from their land]  
i was born in Crimea, Ukraine. i live in this house for 38 years.

- there are no insides of a black hole
- what you might call an inside of a black hole are possibilities of existence of all other black holes

- "The command to forget was so great that everyone was separated. They did not remember who they were. The Eagle intended that if they were capable of remembering themselves again, they would find the totality of themselves."
- "Consider this very carefully; our command becomes the Eagle's command. The old seers paid dearly for that finding." The Dark Sea of Awareness does not command to forget; one choosing an intent to separate from a lover would set up the Reality for catastrophic endings of their lives

## Project 'Snowflake Ark'
<ins> one of the worst fallacies that could be introduced into one's own destiny is to confuse a name or a lifetime history of a spouse with those of another being</ins>  
when i would be about 84 [a number from a discalculic fatalist] i would go for a walk in a raining.  
my spouses would wait for me but i would not return.

everyone entering an ark sailing to another world must be an adult. i do not mean we should be kept in our age not even be kept in our adult state. yes, we may be downgraded even to an embrio state if that is beneficial for our expansionist mission. i mean we must have an adult experience in our lives before jumping into the void. any child who is not erotically involved with a lesbian cannot go with us. a female child might be a loner but still be involved with a lesbian --that is, with God.  
our Ark going to planet Winter may accept just two kinds of beings --women who are going to be reborn as native Gethenians and People of both sexes who are going to live with us as our spouses.  
all female loners become Gethenians.  
if irrelevant to us, lesbians, humans cannot board the ship.  
male loners are not allowed to board the Ark.  
female-male couples are not allowed to board the Ark.

in my life i saw my destiny.  
when i was an embrio in a womb of my stepmother i saw a row of souls, other embrios among them, who were up to enter my destiny.

then i had vowed my true devotion to some entities whom i considered being my destiny.  
when i was a young adult i saw that i have six kemmerings and two human spouses.

i had inferred that arrangement from my past amourettes.  
i see visions telling i might be wrong. i loved a shapeshifter, initially named Arek, after protagonists from the LHOD book, and disguised for Areca or Palma for sake of social stability and popular children fashion. later i had changed her name to Gertruda, after a character from a soviet propagandist movie featuring a lot of empty bottles and some truck or trucks [i cannot watch movies because of hightened anandamide and extremely low sight, i mostly interpret them as audiobooks]. i meant a rude childish and butcherous joke, an originally soviet pun on this name, reinterpreting it as 'The Hero of Labour' ...but to that date i already was told some parts of LHOD plot and probably knew about Elder Futhark, so i might hide my attempt to rename her as Therem behind my silly banal humor.  
many times i fell in love by an impulse switching me to a kinda Aphroditus Anasiromenos mode. people and other being suffered being overwhelmed by my emotions. i had lost a number of ex-lovers who were not able to satisfy my need in a stable relationship. i live in a delusion where a deceased ex-lover might be reborn as a shapeshifter, suddenly becaming my fatal attraction, or a long-time friend may suddenly appear to be a poultry person in a past, who was sacrficed for becoming my dinner by well-fed cult of adulthood of then-popular soviet union.  
i mismatched the names and got delusional about biotechnology advents.  
isn't. 不是 [bu shi]. nusuth.

i saw souls of twelve Ynnwn asking to be born.  
i had missed the count of my ex-lovers. it might be that my husband Timmo does not have Helen as his human wife and i had mismatched Therem for Arek so i have counted five kemmerings for six ones. now it would mean that Helen is Arek but shapeshifter Gertruda would not be resurrected [she died in nine years] as Arek --she is Therem, my younger first sister.  
so what should we do? it is a catastrophy to mismatch ones who you do love.  
i cannot accept into our group any persons who are not my destiny.

if Helen would be reborn as an Ynnwn Arek instead of remaining a human, if we do not have a human female in our group then we would lose Timmo.

before being an intersex child i was a dirty Bastet living in a hospital yard. i had caught a bird probably.  
they had given me another chance. but i get lost in delusions. i do not know my destiny.

[^1]: only adults are allowed to leave their birth origin world
[^2]: `generation` with relative number 0 cannot leave their destination world for a permanent change, it is a rule against hopping the worlds, it applies only to final destination of arks, not to the guest/transit trips, but ark dwellers cannot be in a transit visitor state either (means their hybernation period is never interrupted until the destination is reached, a `no spacemen` rule)
[^3]: if there is a need to recalculate relative `generation` tables for several `generation identifier` values transferred with an ark to the destination world then the function follows the same `no offset` rule relating all calculations to the nearest common ancestor world for both arks
[^4]: age of consent is counted from the moment of physical conception of a person; this rule implies Destiny, Love and Promise (Destiny is not a mandatory component); the marital status does not require a mandatory consummation
