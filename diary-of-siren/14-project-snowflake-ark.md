## Prologue
i was reading Stephen Baxter's "Lieserl" now and i have decided to refuse to continue with reading it.  
he had made it as an atheist's point of view.

i had a book draft based on his imagery of photino birds and a woman modified by nanobots, but did never read his books yet.  
it is impossible to rework the draft of my book to exclude his influence.  
maybe i would discontinue that project. anyhow if keeping it active it needs a thorough rewrite because of other issues.

#### Penelope
before yesterday i saw a dreaming in which some dozen of teenage boys gathered under our balcony as suitors or thieves. they were able to get into our flat just walking uphill to our third floor because the ground was connected to the balcony.  
before going to sleep i was considering making a post on my wall but after i saw that dreaming i had felt that it would be a total waste of my relationships with my ex-lovers.  
with that up to be made post i was intending to attack muslims in a response to their allies russians throttling youtube in a last move before the complete ban.  
i saw the guys gathering at our balcony and they intended robbering and beating me or raping me. i saw them imagining me telling them to go away or i would call the police and when my [given] father was up to appear to the noise they were imagining me forcing them out from the balcony or hissing on them to get away while he has not begun fighting or called the police.

after i had waken up i had recollected how empty their eyes and face were. they were animals pretending on their curiousity intercourse. they were fashists entitled on patriarchal property ownership.  
i was their property, a thing of curious bodily design, a sex toy, a slave whose belongings may be alienated by their entitlement rights.  
i was expected to be a giver. they were searching for a woman to fuck but were dumbed finding an intersex person.  
they were entitled to alienate my woman from me by their fashist patriarchal laws.

i was going to post my verse "i cannot bear your children but i can bring you the stars" on my wall and probably to add something like "'Ynnwn are born without hymen because on Winter we do not have rape, our Amha created us so.' Lieserl, Project 'Snowflake Ark'".

then today i have realized that such revelation may put my supporters, me and my ex-lovers into harm's way.  
because it is so unrestrained and touching suppressed topics of the female genitalia and the fucking.

it is the biggest threat to the life --the boys are raised as entitled to a rape.  
they are up to turn into animal-like humans if getting a confirmation of their right to rape girls.

#### Rebirth or Reversal
- `generation counter` is a restricted signed pointer given some <ins>sane value</ins> in an approximate range from unsigned integer size on negative side to unsigned long long size on positive side [maybe less or more, depending on capabilities of a system and lifetime of universe and many other considerations]
- the `generation pointer` points to a `generation identifier` object which may be any label designating a `generation` including the value of `generation pointer` itself
- nullth `generation` is `slacker` in a range of -6 years and +6 years from AD 1980, the birth year of Weaver Meshe (known as Lieserl for human species); this is the point from which a default value of `generation counter` for any living person is calculated with the `generation` step of 12 years
  - a `generation identifier` is applied to a polygamous group where it is assigned adaptively so that a difference between birth year of oldest spouse and youngest spouse in a given group does not exceed 12 years; such adaptivity makes the `generation identifier` being independent from a factual birth date: for two different ploygamous groups where group A has youngest member born AD 1992 and oldest one born AD 1980 while group B has youngest member born AD 1984 and oldest one born AD 1975 the `generation identifier` of all members group A would have +1 greater value then that of group B.
- `generation counter` spawns for newly populated worlds creating new relative `generation` tables, for marriages between dwellers of two different planets becoming possible their respective relative `generation` tables must be synchronised in absolute time relating to the generation `slacker` or to their nearest common ancestor world's table
  - 'synchronised in absolute time' here means `no skip no offset` system: hybernation periods[^1] are not offset onto the relative `generation` tables to prevent a conflation (aliasing) of `generation counter` values AND they are not skipped but added to physical age of the person to become an irrelevant 'phantom' age
    - lets say world Earth sends two arks with persons of the same `generation identifier` simultaneously to worlds A and B; the time in hybernation spent by dwellers of ark A is seven thousand years and for dwellers of ark B that is twelve thousand years; now `no offset` means that the `generation` with relative number 1[^2] leaving world A for world B IS STILL the `generation` with relative number 1 on the world B and[^3] the `generation` with relative number 6 coming next from world A IS STILL the `generation` with relative number 6 at the world B so they cannot become spouses to the `generation` with relative number 2 born from first settlers from world A even if they traveled fast enough
- `generation counter` for an individual person is valid only for continuos living
  - `age reversal` or 'reincarnation after the death' resets the `generation counter` to the current default `generation counter` if given person is not married[^4] but it resets to a `generation identifier` of person's spouses otherwise
  - `rebirth` or 'transformation' does not reset the `generation identifier` but the definition of the transition is 'wild' --a person may be downgraded during transformation significantly --in a tragic accident cases even lose neural tissues [or their viability] completely, as long as person is alive `generation counter` is valid



[^1]: only adults are allowed to leave their birth origin world
[^2]: `generation` with relative number 0 cannot leave their destination world for a permanent change, it is a rule against hopping the worlds, it applies only to final destination of arks, not to the guest/transit trips, but ark dwellers cannot be in a transit visitor state either (means their hybernation period is never interrupted until the destination is reached, a `no spacemen` rule)
[^3]: if there is a need to recalculate relative `generation` tables for several `generation identifier` values transferred with an ark to the destination world then the function follows the same `no offset` rule relating all calculations to the nearest common ancestor world for both arks
[^4]: age of consent is counted from the moment of physical conception of a person; this rule implies Destiny, Love and Promise (Destiny is not a mandatory component); the marital status does not require a mandatory consummation
