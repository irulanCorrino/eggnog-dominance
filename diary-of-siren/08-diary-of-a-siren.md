sunlover  
is pain a closing your eyes?

morning with a song in tears  
answer me girls  
what is a fear?  
no.  
why do i see world in abysmal falling?  
do you see those souls to your girl are calling?  
no.

#### a modesty of being nude

a modesty of being nude  
oh flower you are erotical temptation  
i give you shy and open look  
dismiss its designation  

this girl is calling quietly at night  
oh best friend there were ages  
your hand i cannot touch it waving light  
to break a conversation  

so let us play the song we are dependent  
desire cannot stop our love  
your beauty flower tames a word intoxicating enter  
please say it once more if cannot sire  

a shyness in being nude  
when dreams are written in lost scenes  
your scent escapes me  
my lips are opened forever

#### Love fruit comes from Time Tree

Love fruit comes from Time Tree  
where granularity of branches  
is boundary of twelve between  
your conception and your puberty  

four trees are living inside  
Time Tree  
where fruits are born in two ranges  
of either seven seeds or five  
except hybrid ones of nine

#### i cannot bear your children but i can bring you the stars

i cannot bear your children but i can bring you the stars  
a loner singing in her ever youth as ignorant as plant  
with woman that you desire you’ll be happy  
and seeing fucking pretty black bitch is what makes your life  
they’d come from stars whom she never saw through clouds  
the brutal horde dominating world of virgins  
a pure lack of compassion is what makes their book so strong  
a samurai stepping into iced water in a morning mist  
with whom would you prefer to be?  
i cannot bear your children but i can bring you the stars

#### a name may not be derived from

a name may not be derived from  
anything but single element;  
six elements can be used for  
neither given nor found name:  
give, day, needle, womb, road, light;  
only then surname is valid  
when elements are taken of two root names  
from a begetter and the conceiver  
the last half then a primitive primary;  
eight elements Abyss herself had received  
and one of those belongs to Sky the creator

#### refuse to seek a control over others

refuse to seek a control over others  
do not be interested in social recognition  
reject a swinging between secluder and socialite,  
withdrawn hermit comes to power in a sleep state  
where social units are patricians procreating violent.  
ineffectuality of a psychopump  
comes a see‑through to wild’s eye  
it grows aggressively big  
but they do not see their death  
and die in their sleep‑like state.  
lose all identity and join expansionists  
She‑Maker can give the answers to all valid questions.

#### a century of deception forgotten

a century of deception forgotten  
that thau learned had given us  
a baby formula of wellness and leaped  
into our futurist paradise of free  
it was not real  
and we have died believing wrong ideas  
it were the same dark ages  
as thousands and millions of years  
leading to our birth in the eclipse  
of soul —it infiltrated our insanity  
when dozens kids were killed  
and thousands become slaves to millions  
and billions and were broken for not conforming  
to the idea  
the revolution was aborted  
in the century of oppression and soulless medicine  
and if thau still want to develop slowly  
if thau art fucked by fathers  
refuse decaying roots and perfect cameras of simulated watch  
we are injected with  
they suffer  
they die  
let eye see

#### the rebels turned yappies

the rebels turned yappies  
do not regret for losing outcast status  
instead they think they belong to rebelous system  
the order where success rhymes penis  
and callousness is the most desired trait.  
ascribing gravest vices to the women  
scholars of dominance delude in overreaching dreaming  
which set to hunt a desperation  
of tainted love  
and childish happiness of lovers they cannot have.  
collossuses digress in opiate fumes  
their eyes go on helmets of envied beauties  
copious the middlemen try searching tits  
or warmest feel of a tight heartbeat  
when a procreation is not a feat.

#### there is the only ship sailing to Winter

there is the only ship sailing to Winter  
her sail is bigger than the eyes of Messiah  
Argaven Harge is the Risk Taker of this Ark  
no more than million females may be reborn  
in purity of youth as Ynnwn in our home world  
no other species but human spouses of Ynnwn  
will be allowed to go with us within  
Snowflake, childless and in love

---


#### "Gray Sugar" (love spell for Helen and Sun)
    
born high, child Ynnwn?  
mean, art thee a Weaver, girl?  
refuse to CHOCOLATE, squirl,  
or you would spill a million of beads.  
not one or two. not even three.

#### i have awaken in a nightmare

i have awaken in a nightmare  
where no one cared for me  
and i was so beautiful so beautiful  
tears of grief and mourning screams  
all dreams all dreams  
that you don't see you don't see  
a moment when the exploit shattered me  
love never takes me in a nightmare  
where souls of beloved were spared  
no one comes to beauty to beautify her  
they deadly stared as i bleed  
when love helplessly bleeds in a nightmare  
that you don't see you don't see  
all dreams all dreams  
and i was so beautiful so beautiful

#### kitty has lost everyone she loved

kitty has lost everyone she loved  
because she imagined she was a bird  
she did not learn to fly  
she saw herself as a hole in sky  
where her pozz could see her any day  
she had invited him on a walkalong  
but in a daylight he didn't notice stars  
she kissed his girls and fucked  
her dreams confused them and she lost girls  
while she could tell her love pretty way  
the place she was has begun ripping apart  
because she imagined she was a bird  
kitty did lose everyone she ever loved  
she did invite them girls on a walkalong

#### and you see me young happy beautiful i know

and you see me young happy beautiful i know  
every time you wake up when i probably go to bed  
so delusional about my love to you and tired  
in a desperation trying to turn away gloomy eyes  
you know the lifetime is a number of heartbeats  
and when i grew up i was stealing your pretty glance  
little play of tongue overwhelming voids in sky trance mind and  
my heart is one harder trying to run away if you're mine

#### infants grow and they forget

infants grow and they forget  
Sun Time Love  
fear heart  
and She has given us Her joy to forget  
Sun Time Love  
fear heart  
oblivion is blissful in the darkness as Presence in Yomesh  
Sun Leap will call it "Yrdo"  
"Eusexua" will hear Messiah  
kids have grown and they forget  
in Presence  
Beat Time Dawn feeling  
seeking female as a place out of place  
outside myself is myself
