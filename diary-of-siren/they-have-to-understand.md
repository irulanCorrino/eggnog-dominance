## they have rehabilitated themselves
i refused to watch SBL's videos at youtube [and i am still on my self-sufficiency framework]  
after they had failed to give me a bass they promised as a giveaway in a challenge (i don't remember  
if i wrote on this my issue with Scott's Bass Lessons on GitHub before) --i had completed most of  
their quests back then but could not enroll due to russia being sanctioned for the war and so ukrainian  
territory of crimea is blocked from PayPal [it was after my right hanfd was broken in september 2022].  
i understand there was no chance for me ...i have no casino-type person addictions  
i know they cannot give anything to anyone able to pluck a string yet ...have to say that ...they're faking  
their giveaways and free gifts, none of us, empoverished musicians ever get any of those.  
...but that was "a neck thick as a grandma's swollen leg" joke that had insulted me so deeply  
--not their faked talks about happiness gotten by neglected children when they receive a guitar for a gift.
