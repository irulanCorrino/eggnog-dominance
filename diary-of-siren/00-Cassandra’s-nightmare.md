that guy, you know, Precocious, he was absolutely loyal to Pooin.  
so if Pooin has ordered his death, which case i very doubt, he would have killed his best supporter.  
and that impression of double entendre in his condolence speach is correct, but he waited for a day and spoke so strangely not because he is a murderer —he was really shocked and really scared.  
Precocious, his very clown, was dead, in such terrifying last moments feeling nothing but extreme frustration of a absolute certainity of imminent death.

all those analiticians, easy to assume Pooin was behind his ex‑pal’s death, were totally wrong. they are not sensitive enough to feel Pooin’s deep terror and regret of the loss.  
like a mutually dependent BDSM pair they could fight or amuse one another, but they killed outsiders and could never dare to break their own union.  
Pooin raised him from the deepest shit. he weaponised Precocious.  
he knew Precocious may never dare to challenge his power and in mutiny days he still was in a doubt of his favorite clown.  
he was scared back then, he could not decide. but they were a pair of mutually dependent sadists. he was accustomed to Precocious’s sadistic sense of humor.  
there was no rivalry over african resources between Precocious and russian MOD —for obvious reason, missed by western pundits —russia CANNOT manifest itself as a shop‑vac for stealing ores from poorest corruption‑torn african countries. because, imagine the international reaction on russian MOD entering those countries —a shock.

sanctions.  
the jet was not serviced by its manufacturer for several years.  
it was erratically moving before falling from the sky.
its engine has caught fire. then it has exploded.

Precocious died of natural reason.  
it was a Reality's revenge.
