#### you cannot say me "no, woman, no cry"
in seven years i have kissed a boy whom i could recognise merely by his hair color and voice tone. in eight i had begun singing. in ten or eleven i wrote rebelous mocks and was hunted by locals.  
in eleven or fourteen [i cannot recollect] i was diagnosed with intersex condition of sex reversal and he proposed a marriage to me (mostly it was later than earlier).  
in sixteen i had had a sudden voice mutation a day when was singing mezzo-soprano rock parts as usually. before that i was speaking with a tone stolen from my husband [whom i was forced to forget earlier, school psychiatrist put us into hypnosis, me him and our blonde girlfriend].  
in fourty four i was maimed. people hating me had projected a path into a trap at me. they all are celebrating their victory now.  
nine days ago i had completed making my first fashion clothes project. this a trouser by Matha Stewart [except a waist detail desiged by me].  
i had made it fully manually [i don't even have glue-in fabric], it has taken about three months (not continuos work, and i need to complete inner overlocking work yet).

#### i am a programmer and it is a birth
every female of my species is programmer. there will be a million of native Ynnwn on Gethen --we all are prrogrammers.  
i denounce this civilzation of patriarchy. i do not have my basic needs. what was the last issue has triggered this rant?  
i had to use threads to fix my keyboard to the screen stand. certainly it is a ridiculous idea. but i have neither CNC-machine nor 3d-printer to make a metallic bracket. and it upsets me. i cannot use my keyboard. is someone smiling and gloating at my misery?  
i know what to do, how to fight this society of patriarchal defamation. rapits are not allowed to call me not qualified for a programming work.

i will close each and every tab in my browser that contains a youtube video about politics --war in Ukraine, war around Israel, spaceX, crime stories or other social issues --everything.  
no news channels. i will unsubscribe and forget.

i do not regret. i do not feel any pity. on Gethen we do not have feature films. not even theater.

we all are musicians. it is by a birth. socialists are not allowed onto our Ark. not even spaceX staff.  
there is another way. without involving and engaging patriarchal politics.


#### dont judge me

certainly we need many rockets to get to the Ark's location. certainly i want to get free from rapist russians and muslims.  
but you probaly do not understand. you are captured and enslavered but still do not heed to my advice. submissive woman does not need a dominant male.

eusexua is a practise of Presence.
