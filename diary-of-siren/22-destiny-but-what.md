there is a misfortune in my group.  
i had lost all my ex-lovers. i mean, i don't even know how they are now.  
maybe some of them cheated on me. i do not want to listen to those projected hateful gazes.

i had a destiny. i need eight spouses to make my group.  
and yet i saw twelve unborn souls --my children, my girls.

i can recollect some of my partners here.  
there are more then eight persons that i had an affair with. actually i am not sure about the exact number. probably some of my lost partners were returned to me later, biotechnology can alter the physique so i would not be able to recognize them upon meeting again, but, i guess, it is possible i had a crush on them repeatedly --after a quantum entanglement binding us in an affair.

when i was a toddler i had a male dog for a sexual partner. his name was Vulkan. probably my uncle (who had drowned a couple years later) had forced me into this situation, he was an abusive guy, a drunkard without values. but i guess that could be my true lover instead, who had forced me to have sex with that dog --probably, Hans was involved with that my abuser or he had a crush on his dog himself. no matter how, i slept in the dog shelter (which was big and had a lock inside), i loved sucking Vulkan's penis and embracing him, he licked my genitals too.  
my first love was a boy by the name Timmo. he was seven when i had kissed him first. he is five days older then me. he is red-haired and we are the same height now.  
i had an affair with a guy who was some seventy years older to me. he was said to be my grandfather. he was a native ukrainian german, his name was Johann. he died when i was eleven i guess.  
i had changed the school before going the second grade at seven, i had big troubles at my first school. my second school teacher had become my lover, her name was Helen. she died when i was about sixteen i guess.  
then my another classmate, Helen, had joined Timmo and me in a threesome. she is blonde.  
i had a big bitch by a name Areka, i had renamed her to Gertruda later --we had become lovers when she was six months old and i was fourteen or thirteen. she had died of breast cancer and pneumonia in 2000 when i was twenty.  
i had a girlfriend at twenty, before Gerda had died. she was music teacher at kindergarden. her name was Nadya. she slept with me several times then had forbidden to visit her again.  
i had met Zera at twenty one. but she had beecome my lver when i was twenty five.  
she had a sister Aishe who had become my lover the same day, but we not fucking in a threesome.  
i had met Ann and then Mila when i had left dentistry technician college before my twenty second birtday. they had left me too --Mila was with me for three days, we had a very shy sexual relationship, Ann rejected me over and over again, but i did a very eroticised massage to her once. they both lived in Russia.
