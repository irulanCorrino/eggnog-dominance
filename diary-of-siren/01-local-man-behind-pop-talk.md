when i was 22 or 23 i studied alto sax —once i was going home and a pre‑teen or teen boy has said to his pals —"krasivyj —saks!" in russian [certainly] so it was meant to be "handsom [guy], sucks".  

a half a year ago [probably] i was walking in headphones and they were not the latest bt5.0 $8‑worth counterfeit in‑ear jammers from China. maybe they were my studio ones or my cheap bt ones —that is not important —some 10y.o. boys were walking and i had heard one saying "tank!" on me.  

i was going to a shop singing at night several days ago —and even though i was very quiet at the moment when some older school boys were passing by but one of them had begun "dunking" on me imitating a dancing DJ.  

and last time i was returning from a shop at night —there was a rest between songs [probably] —i heard an older schoolboy telling "he has calculated his salary!" when i approaching them.  
they were informed of signs "GitHub" and "GPL-3-0" and "IQ==60" and "naturally high. anandamide: [...] counting to the Two" written on my wall.  
i carry a hand gripper and a stretcher with me. they know i had my hand broken last autumn. they were informed it was in a fight.  

in a day i was singing when walking and while passing a bench in a central park near to "The Home of The Culture" i heard a [probably] soviet‑aged guy loudly saying in russian "fucked into the mouth!!!" to his wife [i have low sight, was busy, not sure].  

they all are informed about my [hypothetical] affair with my best friend, a trance DJ and [while we were schoolers] a  basketball team captain.  
i was near laundry rack in the yard and two guys on a motorbike were passing —one shouted to his pal "u kotorogo huya net!" ["that one not having the cock"]. they are informed about my qr‑code graffiti as well.  
they still SAY I AM A GUY.  

so, my children and my friends and my ex‑lovers, those tv‑educated people do not believe in existence of the genetic code and chromosomes.
