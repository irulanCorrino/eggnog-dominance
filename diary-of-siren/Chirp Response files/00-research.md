That sounds like a fascinating project! Developing a new spoken language can involve various aspects, including phonetics, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural context. Here are some areas you might want to consider in your research:

- Phonetics and Phonology: Explore the sounds that will be used in the language. What phonetic inventory will you include? Will it have unique sounds not found in existing languages?

- Grammar and Syntax: Determine the grammatical structure of the language. Will it follow a subject-verb-object order, or will it have a different structure? Consider how tense, aspect, and mood will be expressed.

- Vocabulary Development: Think about how you will create new words. Will you borrow from existing languages, or will you create entirely new roots? Consider how words will be formed and how they will evolve over time.

- Cultural Context: A language is often deeply tied to the culture of its speakers. What cultural elements will influence the language? How will idioms, expressions, and social norms be reflected in the language?

- Pragmatics and Usage: Consider how the language will be used in different contexts. What are the social rules for communication? How will politeness, formality, and other pragmatic aspects be handled?

- Documentation and Teaching: Think about how you will document the language for others to learn. Will you create a grammar guide, a dictionary, or teaching materials?

- Community Involvement: If possible, involve a community of speakers or learners in the development process. Their input can provide valuable insights and help shape the language in a way that resonates with its users.

If you have specific questions or need guidance on a particular aspect of your research, feel free to ask!

## the research query

<mark>sorry, had pushed 'enter' button accidentally; re-posting the prompt: i need to perform a kind of research which i cannot leverage myself. i am participating in a development of a new spoken language (note the distinction --not 'new constructed', but 'new spoken'). i have invented much of language basics already and my own work and the project itself stems from the works of Ursula Kroeber Le Guin. it is a language of biotechnologically altered descendants of human species populating those planets in a habitable zone of a stellar system that are a little colder than Earth is, that is --'glaciated worlds', worlds are too extreme and inhospitable for human species (although humans can live there, just without much comfort). these new creatures do not have biological sex but undergo 'a gender-shift' from a latent state to a defined gender during a period of estrus (called 'kemmer') under influence of a pheromone of an object of interest or, sometimes, under influence of a situation. the language (called 'Karhidish' in English), which this project aims to develop, must be adapted for the reality and needs of these ambivalent species. i had used words from my inner hearing for the most of new language's words, while re-using (loaning) a few from human languages (mostly descendants of PIE), languages i used to encounter during my living here on Earth. but for all of them, literally, for all the words i use runes (Elder Futhark) and assigned them elemental meanings to create the semantics of Karhidish language; plus i check PIE roots for building a correlation with the root in question and 'elemental' semantical value that must be recovered from the ancestral languages to translate that into Elder Futhark symbols (it is convenient to imagine these symbols as 'symbols' of a computer code, say, 'functions'). so here is the problem which i need to solve --those words i had taken from my 'inner hearing' *might be* coming from other living persons or even memories of deceased ones, our ancestors, or maybe even from souls of unborn ones --from my own daughters, for example. and the research, that i cannot leverage myself, is a search of cognates of the pronouns i have created; while i am sure of third-person singular pronoun 'in' which i had intentionally adopted from Chinese second-person singular pronoun 'in' ('thou' in English), or inanimate pronoun 'bu' [English 'it'] which had come from Japanese negative particle 'bu' ('not'), other ones are seemingly not present in human languages, at least in ones i could check myself. so i need to compile a table of pronouns, phonetically resembling my new ones, to attempt at least to check among existing pronouns, because a search of such phonetic resemblance for all words of all languages is a bit too intense work. here is a list of basic personal pronouns of Karhidish language [followed by English equivalent(s)]: 'shean' (nom., pronounced as [ɹ̠̊˔æan]), 'raidh' (acc., [ɻaɪɟ], with voiced palatal stop) ['I'/'me']; 'beakk' (nom., [bɛakk], ends with a stressed consonant), 'rean' (acc., [ɾɛän]) ['thou'/'thee']; 'air' (nom., [äɪ:ɾ]), 'ria' (acc., [ɾɨɑ] (note, ɨ is different from ɯ, wikipedia erroneously gives following: "Russian 'ты/ty' [t̪ɨ]", while i surely hear [t̪ɯ] in their audio sample https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ru-%D1%82%D1%8B.ogg)) ['we'/'us']; 'quogg' (nom., [qo̞ɔgg], ends with a stressed consonant), 'wid' (acc., [β̞ɪd]) ['you'/'you']; 'in' (nom., [in]), 'ni' (acc., [nɪ]) ['she'/'her', masculine pronouns do not exist in languages of these species]; 'ban' (nom., [bän]), 'nab' (acc., [näb]) ['they'/'them']; 'bu' (nom., acc., [bo̞], inanimate pronoun, never used as an impersonal pronoun, used mostly for processes or artifacts, so 'water' is 'she' but 'wind' is 'it') ['it']. thank you for providing such convenient check-point list in a response to that my prematurely sent prompt, i will re-use it for my work. there are certain quirks of loaning the words from ancestral languages, like Chinese 'u' ['not'] becoming 'definite article in Karhidish, or Japanese 'bu' becoming 'inanimate pronoun' in Karhidish, so it is surely might be quiet hard to backtrace our pronouns if they come from seemingly unrelated meanings, but what about compiling a list of closest phonetic matches of pronouns in some more or less studied languages?</mark>

Your project on the Karhidish language sounds incredibly rich and imaginative, and the context you've provided adds depth to the linguistic exploration. Compiling a list of phonetic matches for the pronouns you've created can indeed be a challenging but rewarding task. Below is a table of the Karhidish pronouns you provided, along with a search for phonetic similarities in various languages.

### Karhidish Pronouns and Phonetic Matches

Karhidish Pronoun | English Equivalent | Phonetic Representation | Potential Cognates/Phonetic Matches |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
shean | I/me | [ɹ̠̊˔æan] | Mandarin Chinese: "xiān" (先, meaning "first") | Irish: "sean" (old)
raidh | I/me | [ɻaɪɟ] | Scottish Gaelic: "rath" (prosperity) | Old Norse: "rað" (counsel)
beakk | thou/thee | [bɛakk] | Old English: "beo" (to be) | Finnish: "pää" (head)
rean | thou/thee | [ɾɛän] | Welsh: "rhiain" (girl) | Irish: "ré" (time)
air | we/us | [äɪ:ɾ] | Old English: "wē" (we) | German: "wir" (we)
ria | we/us | [ɾɨɑ] | Russian: "я" (ya, I) | Finnish: "me" (we)
quogg | you | [qo̞ɔgg] | Old English: "þū" (thou) | German: "du" (you)

ni | she/her | [nɪ] | Russian: "ни" (ni, not) | Finnish: "ni" (you)
ban | they/them | [bän] | Old English: "bēon" (to be) | Irish: "ban" (white)
nab | they/them | [näb] | Hebrew: "נב" (nav, to be) | Arabic: "نَبَأَ" (naba, news)
bu | it | [bo̞] | Japanese: "ぶ" (bu, negative particle) | Mandarin Chinese: "不" (bù, not)

#### Notes on Phonetic Matches

> - The phonetic matches are approximate and may not have direct semantic connections. The focus is on phonetic resemblance rather than meaning.
> - Some matches may come from languages that are less studied or have limited resources available, so further research may be needed to confirm their relevance.
> - Consider exploring lesser-known languages or dialects, as they may provide unique phonetic matches that are not present in more widely studied languages.

#### Further Research Suggestions

> - Utilize linguistic databases and resources such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) or the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to explore phonetic similarities.
> - Engage with linguistic communities or forums where you can share your findings and seek input from others who may have insights into phonetic cognates.
> - Consider using software tools for phonetic analysis that can help identify similarities across a broader range of languages.

#### Conclusion

This approach should help you compile a more comprehensive list of potential cognates for your Karhidish pronouns. If you have any specific languages in mind or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
